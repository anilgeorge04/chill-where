# Chill Where

So you subscribed to Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney, Hulu, Hotstar...alright alright...to a whole LOT of content! 

You come across a movie or TV show you want to watch.
Do you then go into each platform one by one to check which one has it? Sounds tedious.
Run the search from one place. Skip typing the URLs and search keyword again and again.
Use **Chill Where** to find your favorite movies and TV shows faster.
